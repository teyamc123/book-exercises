##This is my report!

This is **example** text that can be put into here
Using curly brackets means it is executable code

This is the code we will look at in class. Thisis just plain old Markdown that lets you rendertext in **bold** or _italics_. However, you canput in a block of R code, and the document willshow the code and the results!

We can put arguments in the r function as well, the _echo_ means you won't be able to see the code block in the knit

_include_ means not to show anything that has to do with the code



``` {r example}
library(knitr)
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)

numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)

img_url <- "![puppies](https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/samoyed-MG-long.jpg)"

letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)

# "return" the table to render it
kable(df)
```

this mean is the `r numbers_mean`

No matter what, these will all pull from the same file, so the variable _numbers_ can be accessed in this chunk as well
```{r other_chunk}
print(numbers)
```
